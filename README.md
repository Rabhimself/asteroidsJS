# Asteroids
##A remake of the original Asteroids using Javascript and jQuery.
**By Robert Bryant**

The goal is to destory all the asteroids, preferably without ramming them. If you do collide with an asteroid, it's game over, man!

The controls are simple
- **W** Will push the ship in the direction it is facing
- **S** Will push the ship in the opposite direction that it is facing
- **A** Will spin the ship counter-clockwise
- **D** Will spin the ship clockwise
- **Spacebar** Shoots the ship's gun

Be careful though, when you shoot larger asteroids they tend to break apart into smaller ones! So be sure to give yourself some room!

There are 3 difficulty levels, the harder the difficulty, the more asteroids!
